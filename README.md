# ChromiumFox
I want to love Chrome, but Chrome doesn't love me. I still love the Chromium style UI, so I have remade it for Firefox.

# What devices are ChromiumFox supported on?
ChromiumFox is supported on Windows, Macs, and Linux. ChromiumFox is not officially supported on Chromebooks or any mobile device running Android or iOS.

# Can ChromiumFox be used on Firefox forks?
Yes, ChromiumFox can be used on forks of Firefox and Firefox based web browsers, as long as they haven't heavily modified any UI elements.
Currently known working forks of Firefox are:
1. LibreWolf
2. Waterfox*
3. Floorp*
4. Basilisk**
5. Tor (Not fully tested)

   
*You will have a less chrome-like experience then regular firefox or another fork
**Barely works at all with major issues and is highly advised against

# What browsers don't work with ChromiumFox?
1. Any browser based off of Chromium
2. Pale Moon
3. Safari
4. Edge
5. IceCat

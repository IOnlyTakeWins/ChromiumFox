# What is ChromiumFox?
I want to love Chrome, but Chrome doesn't love me. Still, I enjoy the Chromium-style UI â€” so I recreated it for Firefox. ChromiumFox brings a Chrome-like look to the privacy-respecting Firefox platform.

# What devices are ChromiumFox supported on?
ChromiumFox is supported on Windows, Macs, and Linux. ChromiumFox is not officially supported on Chromebooks or any mobile device running Android or iOS.

# Can ChromiumFox be used on Firefox forks?
Yes, ChromiumFox can be used on forks of Firefox and Firefox based web browsers, as long as they haven't heavily modified any UI elements.
Currently known working forks of Firefox are:
1. LibreWolf
2. Waterfox*
3. Floorp*
4. Basilisk**
5. Tor (Not fully tested)

   
*You will have a less chrome-like experience than regular firefox or another fork
**Barely works at all with major issues and is highly advised against

# What browsers don't work with ChromiumFox?
1. Any browser based off of Chromium (ex: Chrome, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, etc)
2. Pale Moon
3. Safari
4. Edge
5. IceCat


# Why use ChromiumFox over Firefox or Chrome?
Some users prefer the privacy, security, and flexibility of Firefox, but still enjoy the sleek, familiar UI of Chrome. ChromiumFox has the best of both worlds by bringing a recreation of the Chromium UI to the Firefox platform.
